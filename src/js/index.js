/** Recommanded and Good */

/** Good only but not meaningful name*/
const u = []; 
const abcd = []; 
const Users = [];

/** For Plural give plural words only eg.users */
const user = [];

/** Don't give your own names*/
const usersuers = []; 

/** bad if functionlity is related to users not customers. */

/** 

Types of variables 
- let (It is scope variable we can update the after initialization)
- const (It is scope variable we can't update the after initialization. It is for const values)
- var (IT is global scope variable we can update after initialization)

 Tips:
 - If variable declared and not using in ur project. 
 - Please remove those variables why because we are unnessary wasting our memory.
 - In java there is garbase collection is there if you not using declared variable.
 - the garbase collection clean those variables.
 - For javascript you only clean that variable.

 In JavaScript
 - Varibles spaces will be allocated in heap memory.
 - Methods spaces will be allocated in stack memory.
